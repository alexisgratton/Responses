		<h1>The Web Designer Exposing the Humanity and Humor of the Internet</h1>
		
		<h2>WOAH!!! Just WOAH! When I first read this article about Jon Lucas' web work, I thought "Wow this is really boring." As the article went on to talk about Lucas studying graphic design at RISD and teaching himself web design because he saw it more as hobby rather than a profession, that's when it started getting interesting. Not only did he teach himself web design, a simple website he created himself was the start of his career. Reading this article opened up my eyes. It made me realize in a way that it's not always about creating complex, complicated websites. You can still have fun with simplicity. The screenshots provided in the article of some of Jon Lucas' development of the websites inspired me to create this very webpage.<br>

		<br>Also might I just add that if you stayed on the websites page too long while reading this article these one hundred creepy eyes would be staring at you.</h2>
